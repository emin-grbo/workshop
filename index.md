# How an Egg Timer App got me every job
[![Website](https://img.shields.io/website-up-down-green-red/http/shields.io.svg)](https://eggtimerbook.framer.website)
 A battle plan for junior devs, this book is guaranteed to increase your chances of landing your first (or 5th) job. It has singlehandadely allowed me to cruise through numerous job interviews and continues to do this to this day. I poured all my knowledge tips and tricks into this 100page book.

C.H.I.P. - Chatty Helping & Informational Pal, is my take on AI assistants. It is exceedingly simple and good looking app (at least I think so), that gets the job done with 0 ads. It allows un-paid users to fully use the app, with occasional popup for a paid version (a man has got to eat).

 unsafe - An app primarily made for the watch, later ported to iOS due to high demand. It allows you to "break" the lock using vibrations, reminiscent of safe-breaking movies from the past.

I was fortunate to be featured on several app review sites, and it even blew up on Reddit one weekend, allowing me to earn over $3,000 in just 2 days!

 My first app has brought me numerous job offers and serves as the inspiration for a book I'm writing (more on that below). This project holds a special place in my heart.

Though it's a simple egg timer app, it harbors more secrets than it may appear.

 A nostalgic sticker pack. Mainly wanted to see how stickerpacks work, but also extremely in love with the old Macintosh design and I needed to channel that üòÖ.
