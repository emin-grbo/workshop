<br>
C.H.I.P. - Chatty Helping & Informational Pal, is my take on AI assistants. It is exceedingly simple and good looking app (at least I think so), that gets the job done with 0 ads. It allows un-paid users to fully use the app, with occasional popup for a paid version (a man has got to eat).

### un:safe

<br>
unsafe - An app primarily made for the watch, later ported to iOS due to high demand. It allows you to "break" the lock using vibrations, reminiscent of safe-breaking movies from the past.
<br><br>
I was fortunate to be featured on several app review sites, and it even blew up on Reddit one weekend, allowing me to earn over $3,000 in just 2 days!

### Runny egg

<br>
My first app has brought me numerous job offers and serves as the inspiration for a book I'm writing (more on that below). This project holds a special place in my heart. 
<br><br>
Though it's a simple egg timer app, it harbors more secrets than it may appear.
<br><br>
It was featured in https://www.appiconbook.com (iOS variant)

### Retro Boi

<br>
A nostalgic sticker pack. Mainly wanted to see how stickerpacks work, but also extremely in love with the old Macintosh design and I needed to channel that üòÖ.
